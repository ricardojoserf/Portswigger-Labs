# 11 - Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to deliver reflected XSS

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.

The application is also vulnerable to reflected XSS via the User-Agent header.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that causes the next user's request to receive a response containing an XSS exploit that executes alert(1).

Note: The lab simulates the activity of a victim user. Every few POST requests that you make to the lab, the victim user will make their own request. You might need to repeat your attack a few times to ensure that the victim user's request occurs as required.

Tip: Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store.

There is a functionality to post a comment:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/2.png)

It is a POST request. We see the User Agent in a parameter:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/3.png)

We intercept and change the User Agent when accessing “/post?postId=6”:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/4.png)

And the parameter “UserAgent” in the POST request to post the comment is now the XSS payload:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/5.png)

So the User Agent is stored and sent when creating the comment. If we set a random value and read the code of the page we can see it is stored as a hidden value in HTML:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/6.png)

We see the value "TESTING":



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/7.png)

We can try to exploit this with a payload like:

```
useragent"><script>alert(1)</script><a href="/test
```



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/8.png)

And the alert message appears:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/9.png)

The GET request is:

```

I will launch HTTP Request Smuggler to try to detect the HTTP smuggling vulnerability:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/10.png)

From the lab description we have this:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/11.png)

In the blog post we can read:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/12.png)

And there are 3 types of HTTP smuggling:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/13.png)

The front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding so the result from the Burp extension is CL.TE:

How to exploit it:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/15.png)

We try to send the malicious GET request after a 0 in the POST request:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/16.png)

If we visit the website we get an invalid request response:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/17.png)

I had to add the Content-Length and at least one character:



![img](images/11%20-%20Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20deliver%20reflected%20XSS/18.png)
