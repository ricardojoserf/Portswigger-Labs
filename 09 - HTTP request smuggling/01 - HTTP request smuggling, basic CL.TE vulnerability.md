# HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method GPOST.

Note: Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.

Tip: Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store.

---------------------------------------------

Intercept the request to “/” and change the HTTP method in the Repeater tab and the method to POST:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1

To smuggle the next request and add a "G" to it:

- *Transfer-Encoding: chunked* because the backend understands it
- *Content-Length: 14* so the G is not part of the payload

```
