# HTTP request smuggling, basic TE.CL vulnerability

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the back-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method GPOST.

Note: Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.

Tip: Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store.

---------------------------------------------

Intercept a request to “/”, change the method to POST, update the Repeater options so the Content-Length is not updated automatically and the protocol to HTTP/1:

If we add a payload to add only 1 character, the “0” character gets added to the next request as well:

The final payload needs:
- *Transfer-Encoding: chunked* for the frontend
- *Content-Length: 4* for the backend: It will take until the “26” characters
- *26* is the size in HEXADECIMAL for the following payload. Calculated as the length of each line + 2 for each new line character ("\\n").
- *GPOST / HTTP/1.1* to execute the GPOST request
- *Content-Length: 10* Because the backend is what understands
- *0* to end the second chunk
- 2 spaces after the “0” character
